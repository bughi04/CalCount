# CalCount
This program implements a simple meal management system using C++. It contains classes for managing ingredients, allowing users to either add, search, and display details of a few ingredients with their associated calorie values, or to simply add their own custom value. The main features include:
- Ingredient Management: Users can add new ingredients along with their calorie information and prevent duplicate entries.
- Display Information: Each ingredient's name and its calorie count can be displayed.
- Basic File Operations: The program includes functionality for reading and writing ingredient data to and from files, supporting persistent data storage.
This program serves as a basic foundation for a nutrition management application, where users can track ingredients and their nutritional content.
